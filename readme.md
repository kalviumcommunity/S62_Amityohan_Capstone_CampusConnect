# Project Idea: Campus Connect
## One-stop platform to collaborate, share, and grow on campus.

Problem Statement:
Many students face the issue of creating all notes by themselves, and most of the time struggle to use the ones that the teacher’s have provided, as they are very lengthy and don't cover the topic properly.

Students are not aware of the events that happen in the campus, so are not able to participate in them or attend them. Even the organizers find it difficult to publicise the event.

Often students tend to sell their resources, such as old electronics/clothes that they no longer use; and they are not able to find another student who needs it. This mostly happens due to the lack of reach.

## Revised Solution:
1. Post & request help: Here students will be able to request other students for notes and would be able to post notes, summaries or class recording and provide essential details about missed lectures.

2. Event Calendar: The calendar would have details about the upcoming events that can be posted by the organizers with their details, i.e.
    - Their contact information
    - When it is held
    - How to participate in it

3. Campus Marketplace: A section of the application where students can sell/trade items like books, electronics etc. within the campus community.
